class NLLLoss(_WeightedLoss):
    r"""The negative log likelihood loss. It is useful to train a classification
    problem with `C` classes.
    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D Tensor assigning
    weight to each of the classes. This is particularly useful when you have an
    unbalanced training set.
    The `input` given through a forward call is expected to contain
    log-probabilities of each class. `input` has to be a Tensor of size either
    :math:`(minibatch, C)` or :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)`
    with :math:`K \geq 1` for the `K`-dimensional case. The latter is useful for
    higher dimension inputs, such as computing NLL loss per-pixel for 2D images.
    Obtaining log-probabilities in a neural network is easily achieved by
    adding a  `LogSoftmax`  layer in the last layer of your network.
    You may use `CrossEntropyLoss` instead, if you prefer not to add an extra
    layer.
    The `target` that this loss expects should be a class index in the range :math:`[0, C-1]`
    where `C = number of classes`; if `ignore_index` is specified, this loss also accepts
    this class index (this index may not necessarily be in the class range).
    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:
    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_{y_n} x_{n,y_n}, \quad
        w_{c} = \text{weight}[c] \cdot \mathbb{1}\{c \not= \text{ignore\_index}\},
    where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight, and
    :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then
    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^N w_{y_n}} l_n, &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}
    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each
            class. If given, it has to be a Tensor of size `C`. Otherwise, it is
            treated as if having all ones.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``None``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When
            :attr:`size_average` is ``True``, the loss is averaged over
            non-ignored targets.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``None``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C)` or :math:`(C)`, where `C = number of classes`, or
          :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of `K`-dimensional loss.
        - Target: :math:`(N)` or :math:`()`, where each value is
          :math:`0 \leq \text{targets}[i] \leq C-1`, or
          :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of
          K-dimensional loss.
        - Output: If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, shape :math:`(N)` or
          :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of K-dimensional loss.
          Otherwise, scalar.
    Examples::

        >>> # input is of size N x C = 3 x 5

        >>> # each element in target has to have 0 <= value < C
        >>> target = torch.tensor([1, 0, 4])
        >>> output = loss(m(input), target)
        >>> output.backward()
        >>>
        >>>
        >>> # 2D loss example (used, for example, with image inputs)
        >>> N, C = 5, 4
        >>> loss = nn.NLLLoss()
        >>> # input is of size N x C x height x width
        >>> data = torch.randn(N, 16, 10, 10)
        >>> conv = nn.Conv2d(16, C, (3, 3))
        >>> m = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)
        >>> # each element in target has to have 0 <= value < C
        >>> target = torch.empty(N, 8, 8, dtype=torch.long).random_(0, C)
        >>> output = loss(m(conv(data)), target)
